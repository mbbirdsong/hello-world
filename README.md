hello-world
===========

Finally, getting back to really using git-hub

The first planned code commits (and project) will be the "Renny in Funderland" OpenGL C project source code.
Then all of my many SketchUp projects (if possible, in some form, exported or otherwise).
Then the Maya animation projects.
